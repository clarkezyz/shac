## Development Approach

When continuing development on the SHAC project, please follow these guidelines:

1. **Priority Order**: Work on tasks in the order presented, with short-term goals taking precedence over medium and long-term goals.

2. **Testing Requirements**: All new functionality must include appropriate tests.

3. **Documentation**: Update this document and other documentation as you make progress.

4. **Backwards Compatibility**: Maintain compatibility with existing code and demos whenever possible.

5. **Performance Considerations**: Always consider the performance implications of new features, especially for real-time applications.

6. **Code Style**: Follow the established code style and organization patterns.

7. **Regular Updates**: Keep this progress document updated with your work - mark completed tasks and add new ones as needed.

## Known Issues and Technical Debt

Issues that should be addressed as development continues:

1. **HRTF Interpolation Quality**: The current interpolation methods could be improved for smoother transitions.

2. **Memory Usage**: Large sound scenes can consume significant memory; optimization is needed.

3. **Real-time Performance**: Complex scenes may cause performance issues on lower-end hardware.

4. **Error Handling**: Some edge cases may not be handled gracefully.

5. **File Format Robustness**: The SHAC file format needs better validation and error recovery.

6. **Test Coverage**: Not all components have comprehensive test coverage.

7. **Documentation Gaps**: Some complex functionality lacks detailed documentation.
